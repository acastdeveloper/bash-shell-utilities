# bash-shell-utilities

Collection of scripts in order to automate little, repetitive tasks in linux.

## Put in /usr/local/bin

- **upda**: This is a little script that updates  "apt", "flatpak" and  "snap" package managers with just one command bash, in case you have these 3 package managers running in your linux. Otherwise is not useful for you.

- **upup**: It updates and upgrades the **apt** package manager.

## Put this in the folder where you need to use it.

- **sh permi.sh**: I made this script in order to solve the typical Wordpress problems with different privileges for files and folders and files that are inside folders that are inside other folders...
